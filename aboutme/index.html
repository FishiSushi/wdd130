            <p>
                Hi, my name is Jacob Lemieux, I am a Canadian - currently
                residing in the North Eastern U.S.. I am married and have two
                young children.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a self taught Web Developer, I currently work in that
                capacity for a small logistics company based out of Southern
                Ontario (remotely). I am pursuing an Associates in Applied
                Technology, primarily to increase my credibility and fill in any
                gaps in my education.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my opinion the greatest benefit to working in web development
                is that it is constantly changing and evolving - there is always
                something new to learn or explore in that space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a huge nerd. I love books, movies, video/table-top games of
                all kinds - and exploring new software development tools:
                languages, frameworks/libraries, and methodologies.
            </p>
